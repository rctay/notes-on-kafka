# Spring for Apache Kafka

## Consumer configuration and testing

To see different different configuration styles for a Kafka consumer to listen for messages with a string key and JSON value on the topic `topicA` (and tests!), have a look at the enclosed [kafka-consumer-demo](kafka-consumer-demo/) project. (To pre-empt wonkiness in IntelliJ, try opening the subfolder as its own project in IntelliJ.)
